# HASA-Net:A-non-intrusive-hearing-aid-speech-assessment-network

## Introduction
In this study, we propose a novel DNN-based end to-end, non-intrusive hearing aid speech assessment model, termed HASA-Net, formed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) model. HASA-Net is a unified model capable to simultaneously estimating quality and intelligibility given input speech and specified hearing-loss patterns. Specifically, HASA-Net aims to predict HASQI and HASPI scores, which are two well-known evaluation metrics for speech quality and intelligibility designed for hearing-impaired listeners. In addition, while both HASQI and HASPI are based on a calculation comparing the noisy signal with its clean reference, HASA-Net predicts scores without the need of clean reference. 

## Major Contribution
HASA-Net represents the first step towards an end-to-end, non-intrusive unified model for listeners with hearing aids that simultaneously measures quality and intelligibility.
